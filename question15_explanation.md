# Question 15 Explanation: Holt-Winters Time Series Forecasting Method

## Background Context
This question involves the Holt-Winters additive time series model, which is used for forecasting data that exhibits both trend and seasonal patterns. The model is particularly valuable for business forecasting where historical patterns help predict future values. This advanced forecasting method extends simple exponential smoothing to handle more complex data patterns.

## The Problem
**Given Holt-Winters Model Parameters**:
- **n** = 16 (observation number)
- **alpha (α)** = 0.2 (level smoothing parameter)
- **gamma (γ)** = 0.1 (trend smoothing parameter)  
- **delta (δ)** = 0.1 (seasonal smoothing parameter)
- **L** = 4 (seasonal cycle length - quarterly data)
- **SSE** = 20.0810 (sum of squared errors)

**Data Point**: Period 1, Quarter 1, y(1) = 10

**Missing Values to Calculate**: (1) through (10)

## Key Concepts in Holt-Winters Method

### Components of Holt-Winters Model
The additive Holt-Winters method decomposes time series into:

1. **Level (Lt)**: The baseline value around which the series fluctuates
2. **Trend (bt)**: The long-term direction of change
3. **Seasonal Factors (St)**: Regular patterns that repeat each cycle
4. **Error**: Random variation not explained by other components

### Mathematical Formulation

**Level Equation**:
```
Lt = α(yt - St-L) + (1-α)(Lt-1 + bt-1)
```

**Trend Equation**:
```
bt = γ(Lt - Lt-1) + (1-γ)bt-1
```

**Seasonal Equation**:
```
St = δ(yt - Lt) + (1-δ)St-L
```

**Forecast Equation**:
```
Ft+h = Lt + h×bt + St+h-L
```

### Parameter Interpretation
- **α (0.2)**: Moderate responsiveness to level changes
- **γ (0.1)**: Low responsiveness to trend changes (stable trend)
- **δ (0.1)**: Low responsiveness to seasonal pattern changes (stable seasonality)

## Step-by-Step Calculations

### Given Initial Values
From the regression component:
- **Intercept**: 19.8500
- **Trend coefficient**: 0.7450

### Seasonal Factors (from table)
- **S₋₃**: -11.5650 (Q2 of previous year)
- **S₋₂**: 9.4400 (Q3 of previous year)  
- **S₋₁**: 21.6950 (Q4 of previous year)
- **S₀**: -7.5500 (Q1 baseline)

### Period 1 Calculations (t=1, Q1, y₁=10)

#### (1) Forecast for Period 1
```
F₁ = L₀ + 1×b₀ + S₁₋₄ = 19.85 + 0.745 + (-11.565) = 9.030
```
**Answer (3)**: 9.030

#### (2) Forecast Error  
```
Error₁ = y₁ - F₁ = 10 - 9.030 = 0.970
```
**Answer (4)**: 0.970

#### (5) Squared Forecast Error
```
Sq(FCE₁) = (0.970)² = 0.9409
```
**Answer (5)**: 0.9409

#### Update Level (6)
```
L₁ = α(y₁ - S₁₋₄) + (1-α)(L₀ + b₀)
L₁ = 0.2(10 - (-11.565)) + 0.8(19.85 + 0.745)
L₁ = 0.2(21.565) + 0.8(20.595)
L₁ = 4.313 + 16.476 = 20.789
```
**Answer (6)**: 20.789

#### Update Trend (7)
```
b₁ = γ(L₁ - L₀) + (1-γ)b₀
b₁ = 0.1(20.789 - 19.85) + 0.9(0.745)
b₁ = 0.1(0.939) + 0.6705
b₁ = 0.0939 + 0.6705 = 0.764
```
**Answer (7)**: 0.764

#### Update Seasonal Factor (8)
```
S₁ = δ(y₁ - L₁) + (1-δ)S₁₋₄
S₁ = 0.1(10 - 20.789) + 0.9(-11.565)
S₁ = 0.1(-10.789) + 0.9(-11.565)
S₁ = -1.0789 + (-10.4085) = -11.487
```
**Answer (8)**: -11.487

#### Remaining Calculations

**Answer (1)**: ŷ₁ = L₀ + b₀ = 19.85 + 0.745 = 20.595

**Answer (2)**: Regression Error = y₁ - ŷ₁ = 10 - 20.595 = -10.595

**Answer (9)**: s² = SSE/(n-3) = 20.0810/(16-3) = 20.0810/13 = 1.5447

**Answer (10)**: s = √1.5447 = 1.2429
