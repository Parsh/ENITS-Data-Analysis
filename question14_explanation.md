# Question 14 Explanation: Single-Server Queuing System Analysis for Call Center Operations

## Background Context
Telco Company's risk management department is concerned about increasing customer complaints due to call center delays. They need to evaluate their current queuing system performance and determine if service goals are being met. This analysis helps optimize customer service operations while managing operational costs.

## The Problem
**Current System Parameters**:
- **Arrival rate (λ)**: 2.5 customers per hour (Poisson arrivals)
- **Service time**: 10 minutes per customer on average
- **Service rate (μ)**: 60/10 = 6 customers per hour (exponential service)
- **System type**: M/M/1 (single server with queue)
- **Service goal**: Average waiting time ≤ 5 minutes

## Key Concepts in M/M/1 Queuing Theory

### System Characteristics
**M/M/1 Notation**:
- **First M**: Markovian (Poisson) arrivals
- **Second M**: Markovian (exponential) service times
- **1**: Single server
- **∞**: Infinite queue capacity (assumed)

### Traffic Intensity
**ρ = λ/μ = 2.5/6 = 0.4167**

This represents the system utilization rate (41.67% of server capacity used).

### Key Performance Metrics
1. **Lq**: Average number of customers waiting in queue
2. **L**: Average number of customers in system (including being served)
3. **Wq**: Average waiting time in queue
4. **W**: Average total time in system
5. **Pw**: Probability that arriving customer must wait

## Part 1: Operating Characteristics Calculation

### Mathematical Formulas for M/M/1 System

#### Average Number in Queue (Lq)
```
Lq = λ²/[μ(μ-λ)] = ρ²/(1-ρ)
```

**Calculation**:
```
Lq = (2.5)²/[6×(6-2.5)] = 6.25/(6×3.5) = 6.25/21 = 0.2976 customers
```

#### Average Number in System (L)
```
L = Lq + λ/μ = Lq + ρ
```

**Calculation**:
```
L = 0.2976 + 2.5/6 = 0.2976 + 0.4167 = 0.7143 customers
```

#### Average Waiting Time in Queue (Wq)
```
Wq = Lq/λ
```

**Calculation**:
```
Wq = 0.2976/2.5 = 0.1190 hours = 0.1190 × 60 = 7.14 minutes
```

#### Average Total Time in System (W)
```
W = Wq + 1/μ
```

**Calculation**:
```
W = 0.1190 + 1/6 = 0.1190 + 0.1667 = 0.2857 hours = 17.14 minutes
```

#### Probability of Waiting (Pw)
```
Pw = λ/μ = ρ = 0.4167
```

**Interpretation**: 41.67% of arriving customers will have to wait.

### Summary of Operating Characteristics

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Lq** | 0.30 customers | Average queue length |
| **L** | 0.71 customers | Average total in system |
| **Wq** | 7.14 minutes | Average waiting time |
| **W** | 17.14 minutes | Average total time |
| **Pw** | 41.67% | Probability of waiting |
| **ρ** | 41.67% | Server utilization |

## Part 2: Service Goal Assessment

### Current Performance vs Goal
**Service Goal**: Average waiting time ≤ 5 minutes
**Current Performance**: Wq = 7.14 minutes

**Result**: **Goal is NOT being met** (7.14 > 5.0)

### Gap Analysis
- **Performance gap**: 7.14 - 5.0 = 2.14 minutes
- **Relative gap**: (7.14 - 5.0)/5.0 = 42.8% over target
- **Customer impact**: Significant service degradation

### Recommended Actions
1. **Increase service rate**: Reduce average service time per customer
2. **Add servers**: Implement multi-server system (M/M/2)
3. **Demand management**: Spread arrivals more evenly
4. **Process improvement**: Streamline service procedures

## Part 3: Improved Service Rate Analysis

### Scenario: Reduce Service Time to 8 Minutes

**New Parameters**:
- **Service time**: 8 minutes per customer
- **New service rate (μ)**: 60/8 = 7.5 customers per hour
- **Arrival rate (λ)**: Unchanged at 2.5 customers per hour

### Recalculate Performance Metrics

#### New Traffic Intensity
```
ρ = λ/μ = 2.5/7.5 = 0.3333
```

#### New Average Number in Queue
```
Lq = λ²/[μ(μ-λ)] = (2.5)²/[7.5×(7.5-2.5)] = 6.25/(7.5×5) = 6.25/37.5 = 0.1667 customers
```

#### New Average Waiting Time
```
Wq = Lq/λ = 0.1667/2.5 = 0.0667 hours = 4.0 minutes
```

### Service Goal Assessment
**New waiting time**: 4.0 minutes
**Service goal**: ≤ 5.0 minutes

**Result**: **Goal IS being met** (4.0 < 5.0)

### Performance Improvement Summary

| Metric | Original | Improved | Change |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Service time** | 10 min | 8 min | -20% |
| **Service rate (μ)** | 6.0/hr | 7.5/hr | +25% |
| **Waiting time (Wq)** | 7.14 min | 4.0 min | -44% |
| **Queue length (Lq)** | 0.30 | 0.17 | -43% |
| **Utilization (ρ)** | 41.67% | 33.33% | -20% |

3. **Infinite capacity**: Assumes unlimited queue space
4. **Single customer class**: All customers treated identically

#### Real-World Complications
1. **Time-varying demand**: Calls vary by time of day/week
2. **Service variability**: Different call types require different times
3. **Customer behavior**: Abandonment, balking, reneging
4. **System reliability**: Equipment failures, staff breaks

### Monitoring and Control Recommendations

#### Key Performance Indicators
1. **Real-time metrics**: Current queue length, waiting times
2. **Daily averages**: Service level achievement
3. **Trend analysis**: Performance over time
4. **Customer feedback**: Satisfaction surveys

#### Dynamic Management
1. **Staffing flexibility**: Adjust capacity based on demand
2. **Service prioritization**: Handle urgent calls first
3. **Queue management**: Provide waiting time estimates
4. **Continuous improvement**: Regular process optimization

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that:

1. **Current system fails to meet service goals** (7.14 min vs 5.0 min target)
2. **Modest service improvement achieves goals** (8-minute service time reduces waiting to 4.0 minutes)
3. **Implementation is feasible** through process optimization and training
4. **Benefits justify costs** through improved customer satisfaction and operational efficiency

This demonstrates how queuing theory provides quantitative foundation for service system design and optimization, enabling data-driven decisions that balance customer service quality with operational efficiency.
