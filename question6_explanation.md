# Question 6 Explanation: Regression Analysis with Residual Diagnostics and Hypothesis Testing

## Background Context
The Biotech Company has implemented a new cyber-physical manufacturing process after transforming their entire production landscape. Due to several cyber incidents causing downtimes, the controlling department is concerned about the financial impact. A data analyst is evaluating the relationship between downtime duration and total financial losses to understand and predict costs of future incidents.

## The Problem
**Regression Analysis Setup**:
- **Independent variable (x)**: Downtime duration (in minutes)
- **Dependent variable (y)**: Total loss (in T€ - thousands of euros)
- **Regression equation**: ŷ = -1.00 + 1.34 × x

**Given Data**: 11 observations with residual analysis results provided

## Key Concepts in Regression Diagnostics

### Why Residual Analysis Matters
1. **Model Validation**: Check if regression assumptions are met
2. **Outlier Detection**: Identify unusual observations
3. **Normality Assessment**: Ensure residuals are normally distributed
4. **Homoscedasticity**: Check for constant variance
5. **Model Adequacy**: Determine if linear model is appropriate

## Part 1: Histogram Construction for Normality Assessment

### Key Decision: Residuals vs. Standardized Residuals

**Why Use Standardized Residuals?**
- Standardized residuals have mean = 0 and standard deviation ≈ 1
- Easier to interpret and compare across different datasets
- Better for normality assessment using histograms
- Can use standard normal distribution benchmarks

### Data Organization
**Given Standardized Residuals**:
-0.07, 1.04, -0.85, -0.06, -0.85, -0.84, -0.39, 0.81, 0.45, 1.94, -1.43

### Histogram Construction

Following the rule: **Lower Level ≤ Value < Upper Level**

| Bin | Interval | Count | Values in Interval |
|-----|----------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | -2 ≤ Value < -1 | 1 | -1.43 |
| 2 | -1 ≤ Value < 0 | 5 | -0.07, -0.85, -0.06, -0.85, -0.84, -0.39 |
| 3 | 0 ≤ Value < 1 | 3 | 0.81, 0.45 |
| 4 | 1 ≤ Value < 2 | 2 | 1.04, 1.94 |

### Normality Assessment
**Visual Analysis**: 
- The histogram shows a slightly right-skewed distribution
- Most values fall within ±2 standard deviations (normal range)
- Despite slight skewness, the distribution approximates normality
- For practical purposes, the normality assumption is reasonable

**Implications**:
- Statistical tests based on normality assumption are valid
- Confidence intervals and prediction intervals are reliable
- The regression model meets this key assumption

## Part 2: Hypothesis Testing for Regression Coefficients

### Theoretical Framework
We test whether each coefficient is significantly different from zero:

**For Slope (β₁)**:
- H₀: β₁ = 0 (no relationship between downtime and loss)
- H₁: β₁ ≠ 0 (significant relationship exists)

**For Intercept (β₀)**:
- H₀: β₀ = 0 (no fixed cost when downtime = 0)
- H₁: β₀ ≠ 0 (fixed cost exists)

### Calculating Standard Errors

#### Standard Error of Residuals
```
s = √(SSE/(n-2)) = √(38.72/(11-2)) = √(38.72/9) = √4.30 = 2.07
```

#### Standard Error of Slope (sb₁)
```
sb₁ = s/√SSxx = s/√Σ(xi - x̄)² = 2.07/√39.71 = 2.07/6.30 = 0.33
```

Where SSxx = 39.71 (sum of squared deviations from mean for x-values)

#### Standard Error of Intercept
Given: sb₀ = 2.54

### Test Statistics Calculation

#### For Slope (b₁ = 1.34)
```
t = b₁/sb₁ = 1.34/0.33 = 4.07
```

#### For Intercept (b₀ = -1.00)
Given: t = -0.39

### Critical Value Determination
With n = 11, degrees of freedom = n-2 = 9
For α = 0.05 (95% confidence), t₀.₀₂₅,₉ = 2.26

### Hypothesis Test Results

#### Slope Test
- **Test statistic**: |4.07| = 4.07
- **Critical value**: 2.26
- **Decision**: 4.07 > 2.26, so **reject H₀**
- **Conclusion**: The slope is **statistically significant**

#### Intercept Test
- **Test statistic**: |-0.39| = 0.39
- **Critical value**: 2.26
- **Decision**: 0.39 < 2.26, so **fail to reject H₀**
- **Conclusion**: The intercept is **not statistically significant**

### Business Interpretation
1. **Significant Slope**: Each additional minute of downtime significantly increases loss by €1,340
2. **Non-significant Intercept**: There's no statistically significant fixed cost when downtime = 0
3. **Model Validity**: The relationship between downtime and losses is real and measurable

## Part 3: Confidence Intervals for Regression Parameters

### Mathematical Framework
**95% Confidence Interval Formula**:
```
[b ± t₀.₀₂₅,₉ × sb]
```

### Confidence Interval for Intercept (β₀)
```
[-1.00 ± 2.26 × 2.54] = [-1.00 ± 5.74] = [-6.74, 4.73]
```

**Interpretation**: 
- We are 95% confident that the true intercept lies between -€6,740 and €4,730
- Since the interval includes 0, the intercept is not significantly different from 0
- This confirms our hypothesis test result

### Confidence Interval for Slope (β₁)
```
[1.34 ± 2.26 × 0.33] = [1.34 ± 0.75] = [0.59, 2.09]
```

**Interpretation**:
- We are 95% confident that each minute of downtime increases costs between €590 and €2,090
- Since the interval doesn't include 0, the slope is significantly different from 0
- This confirms our hypothesis test result

## Comprehensive Business Analysis

### Practical Implications

#### Cost Prediction Model
```
Expected Loss = -1.00 + 1.34 × Downtime Minutes
```

**Examples**:
- 10 minutes downtime: -1.00 + 1.34(10) = €12,400
- 30 minutes downtime: -1.00 + 1.34(30) = €39,200
- 60 minutes downtime: -1.00 + 1.34(60) = €79,400

#### Risk Management Insights
1. **Linear Relationship**: Losses increase predictably with downtime
2. **No Fixed Costs**: No significant baseline loss when incidents are prevented
3. **Cost Per Minute**: Each minute of downtime costs approximately €1,340
4. **Predictive Capability**: Model can estimate financial impact of potential incidents

### Model Limitations and Considerations

#### Statistical Assumptions Met
✓ **Normality**: Residuals approximately normal
✓ **Linearity**: Linear relationship assumed appropriate
✓ **Independence**: Assuming observations are independent

#### Potential Limitations
1. **Model Simplicity**: Only considers downtime duration, not severity or type
2. **Extrapolation Risk**: Predictions beyond observed data range may be unreliable
3. **External Factors**: Economic conditions, incident type, etc., not considered
4. **Sample Size**: 11 observations provide limited statistical power

### Strategic Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Incident Response**: Prioritize rapid recovery to minimize downtime
2. **Cost Budgeting**: Allocate €1,340 per expected minute of annual downtime
3. **Prevention Investment**: Compare prevention costs to €1,340/minute impact
4. **Response Training**: Train teams to reduce incident duration

#### Long-term Improvements
1. **Data Collection**: Gather more observations to improve model precision
2. **Model Enhancement**: Include additional variables (incident type, time of day, etc.)
3. **Regular Updates**: Recalibrate model as business processes evolve
4. **Scenario Planning**: Use model for business continuity planning
