# Question 8 Explanation: Cybersecurity Regression Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

## Background Context
A company wants to predict the likelihood of cyber-attacks using regression analysis. They collected 10 years of data on past attacks, number of employees, and network vulnerabilities. This analysis helps understand risk factors and develop predictive models for cybersecurity planning.

## The Problem
**Dataset (10 years)**:

| Year | Attacks | Employees | Vulnerabilities |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | 10 | 100 | 20 |
| 2 | 15 | 120 | 25 |
| 3 | 18 | 150 | 30 |
| 4 | 20 | 180 | 35 |
| 5 | 25 | 210 | 40 |
| 6 | 30 | 240 | 45 |
| 7 | 35 | 270 | 50 |
| 8 | 40 | 300 | 55 |
| 9 | 45 | 330 | 60 |
| 10 | 50 | 360 | 65 |

## Part 1: Single Regression Analysis (Attacks vs Vulnerabilities)

### Key Concepts
**Simple Linear Regression**: Models relationship between one independent variable (vulnerabilities) and one dependent variable (attacks).

**Model**: y = β₀ + β₁x + ε
- y = number of attacks
- x = number of vulnerabilities  
- β₀ = intercept, β₁ = slope

### Calculation of Regression Coefficients

#### Mathematical Formulas
```
b₁ = [n∑(xi·yi) - ∑xi·∑yi] / [n∑(xi²) - (∑xi)²]
b₀ = ȳ - b₁·x̄
```

#### Step-by-Step Calculation

**Required Sums**:
- ∑xi = 425 (sum of vulnerabilities)
- ∑yi = 288 (sum of attacks) 
- ∑(xi·yi) = 14,065
- ∑(xi²) = 20,125
- n = 10

**Calculate Slope (b₁)**:
```
b₁ = [10×14,065 - 425×288] / [10×20,125 - (425)²]
   = [140,650 - 122,400] / [201,250 - 180,625]
   = 18,250 / 20,625
   = 0.89
```

**Calculate Means**:
```
ȳ = 288/10 = 28.80
x̄ = 425/10 = 42.50
```

**Calculate Intercept (b₀)**:
```
b₀ = 28.80 - 0.89×42.50 = 28.80 - 37.83 = -9.03
```

**Regression Equation**: **ŷ = -9.03 + 0.89x**

## Part 2: Interpret Regression Coefficients

### Model Interpretation

**Slope (0.89)**:
- For each additional vulnerability, attacks increase by 0.89 on average
- **Positive relationship**: More vulnerabilities lead to more attacks
- Strong practical significance for cybersecurity planning

**Intercept (-9.03)**:
- Theoretical number of attacks when vulnerabilities = 0
- Negative value suggests the linear model may not be appropriate for very low vulnerability counts
- In practice, some minimum level of vulnerabilities always exists

### Business Implications
1. **Risk Assessment**: Vulnerabilities are a strong predictor of attack frequency
2. **Prevention Strategy**: Reducing vulnerabilities should reduce attacks
3. **Resource Allocation**: Prioritize vulnerability management
4. **Forecasting**: Can predict attacks based on current vulnerability levels

## Part 3: Hypothesis Testing for Second Model (Attacks vs Employees)

### Model Information
**Given for second regression (Attacks vs Employees)**:
- b₀ = -5.15 (intercept)
- b₁ = 0.15 (slope)  
- sb₀ = 1.15 (standard error of intercept)
- sb₁ = 0.005 (standard error of slope)
- t₈,₀.₀₂₅ = 2.31 (critical value)

### Hypothesis Tests

#### Test for Slope Coefficient
**Hypotheses**:
- H₀: β₁ = 0 (no relationship between employees and attacks)
- H₁: β₁ ≠ 0 (significant relationship exists)

**Test Statistic**:
```
t = b₁/sb₁ = 0.15/0.005 = 30
```

**Decision Rule**: Reject H₀ if |t| > t₈,₀.₀₂₅ = 2.31

**Result**: |30| = 30 > 2.31, so **reject H₀**

**Conclusion**: The slope coefficient is **statistically significant**.

#### Test for Intercept Coefficient
**Hypotheses**:
- H₀: β₀ = 0 (no fixed baseline attacks)
- H₁: β₀ ≠ 0 (significant baseline exists)

**Test Statistic**:
```
t = b₀/sb₀ = -5.15/1.15 = -4.48
```

**Decision Rule**: Reject H₀ if |t| > t₈,₀.₀₂₅ = 2.31

**Result**: |-4.48| = 4.48 > 2.31, so **reject H₀**

**Conclusion**: The intercept coefficient is **statistically significant**.

### Business Interpretation
Both coefficients are significant, meaning:
1. **Baseline Risk**: Even with minimal employees, there's a measurable attack risk
2. **Scale Effect**: Larger organizations face more attacks
3. **Linear Relationship**: Attack frequency increases predictably with organization size

## Part 4: Confidence Intervals for Regression Parameters

### Mathematical Framework
**95% Confidence Interval**: [b ± t₈,₀.₀₂₅ × sb]

### Confidence Interval for Slope (β₁)
```
[0.15 ± 2.31 × 0.005] = [0.15 ± 0.012] = [0.138, 0.162]
```

**Interpretation**: We're 95% confident that each additional employee increases attacks by between 0.138 and 0.162.

### Confidence Interval for Intercept (β₀)
```
[-5.15 ± 2.31 × 1.15] = [-5.15 ± 2.66] = [-7.81, -2.49]
```

**Interpretation**: We're 95% confident that the baseline attack level is between -7.81 and -2.49.

## Comprehensive Analysis and Comparison

### Model Comparison

| Factor | Model 1 (Vulnerabilities) | Model 2 (Employees) |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Slope | 0.89 attacks/vulnerability | 0.15 attacks/employee |
| Intercept | -9.03 | -5.15 |
| Relationship | Strong positive | Positive but smaller effect |
| R² (implied) | Higher | Lower |
| Business Logic | Direct causation | Indirect association |

### Strategic Insights

#### Primary Risk Factors
1. **Vulnerabilities** have stronger predictive power than organizational size
2. **Direct vs Indirect**: Vulnerabilities directly enable attacks; employees create exposure
3. **Management Priorities**: Focus on vulnerability reduction over size management

#### Practical Applications

**Vulnerability Management**:
- Each vulnerability eliminated prevents ~0.89 attacks annually
- ROI calculation: Cost of vulnerability remediation vs attack cost savings

**Organizational Planning**:
- Growing companies should scale security with headcount
- Each 100 new employees may increase attacks by ~15 annually
- Plan security resources proportional to organizational growth

### Model Limitations and Considerations

#### Statistical Assumptions
1. **Linearity**: Assumes linear relationships (may not hold at extremes)
2. **Independence**: Each year's data assumed independent
3. **Normality**: Residuals should be normally distributed
4. **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance across predictions

#### Business Limitations
1. **Causation vs Correlation**: Statistical relationships don't prove causation
2. **External Factors**: Economic conditions, threat landscape changes not captured
3. **Data Quality**: Accuracy of attack and vulnerability counts
4. **Time Trends**: Models don't account for changing cyber threat environment

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Prioritize vulnerability management** based on stronger predictive power
2. **Scale security teams** with organizational growth
3. **Regular model updates** with new data
4. **Combine approaches**: Use both factors in comprehensive risk models

#### Advanced Analytics
1. **Multiple regression**: Combine vulnerabilities and employees in one model
2. **Time series analysis**: Account for temporal trends
3. **Non-linear models**: Explore polynomial or exponential relationships
4. **Machine learning**: Consider more sophisticated predictive models

This analysis demonstrates how regression analysis can quantify cybersecurity risks and support evidence-based security decisions.
