# Question 4 Explanation: Matrix Operations for Multiple Regression Analysis

## Background Context
Navindra Kalpakutta is a new business analyst at India Hightech Corporation. On his first day, the IT systems crashed, interrupting a multiple regression analysis studying data breach costs. He needs to manually complete matrix calculations to estimate the regression coefficients using the normal equations method.

## The Problem
We have a multiple regression model studying:
- **Dependent variable**: Cost of data breaches (in T€)
- **Independent variables**: 
  - Downtime in operations A (in minutes)
  - Downtime in operations B (in minutes)

**Given information**:
```
(X'X) = [6  8  9 ]     X'y = [120]
        [10 5  7 ]            [150]
        [8  5  6 ]            [160]
```

## Key Concepts in Matrix Algebra for Regression

### The Normal Equations
In multiple regression, we solve: **X'Xb = X'y**

Where:
- **X**: Design matrix (independent variables plus constant column)
- **b**: Vector of regression coefficients we want to find
- **y**: Vector of dependent variable values

**Solution**: **b = (X'X)⁻¹X'y**

### Why Matrix Inversion is Needed
- Linear regression involves solving a system of equations
- Matrix inversion provides a systematic way to solve for unknown coefficients
- The inverse (X'X)⁻¹ exists only if X'X is non-singular (determinant ≠ 0)

## Part 1: Calculate the Determinant of (X'X)

### Mathematical Foundation
For a 3×3 matrix:
```
det(A) = a₁₁(a₂₂a₃₃ - a₂₃a₃₂) - a₁₂(a₂₁a₃₃ - a₂₃a₃₁) + a₁₃(a₂₁a₃₂ - a₂₂a₃₁)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation
```
(X'X) = [6  8  9 ]
        [10 5  7 ]
        [8  5  6 ]
```

**Expanding along the first row**:
```
det(X'X) = 6×|5 7| - 8×|10 7| + 9×|10 5|
              |5 6|      |8  6|      |8  5|

= 6×(5×6 - 7×5) - 8×(10×6 - 7×8) + 9×(10×5 - 5×8)
= 6×(30 - 35) - 8×(60 - 56) + 9×(50 - 40)
= 6×(-5) - 8×(4) + 9×(10)
= -30 - 32 + 90
= 28
```

**Answer**: det(X'X) = **28**

### Interpretation
Since the determinant is non-zero, the matrix is invertible, meaning our regression problem has a unique solution.

## Part 2: Develop the Cofactor Matrix C

### Key Concepts
**Cofactor**: For element aᵢⱼ, the cofactor Cᵢⱼ = (-1)ⁱ⁺ʲ × Mᵢⱼ
where Mᵢⱼ is the minor (determinant of the 2×2 matrix after removing row i and column j)

### Step-by-Step Calculation

**Position (1,1)**: C₁₁ = (-1)¹⁺¹ × |5 7| = 1 × (30-35) = **-5**
                                      |5 6|

**Position (1,2)**: C₁₂ = (-1)¹⁺² × |10 7| = -1 × (60-56) = **-4**
                                      |8  6|

**Position (1,3)**: C₁₃ = (-1)¹⁺³ × |10 5| = 1 × (50-40) = **10**
                                      |8  5|

**Position (2,1)**: C₂₁ = (-1)²⁺¹ × |8 9| = -1 × (48-45) = **-3**
                                      |5 6|

**Position (2,2)**: C₂₂ = (-1)²⁺² × |6 9| = 1 × (36-72) = **-36**
                                      |8 6|

**Position (2,3)**: C₂₃ = (-1)²⁺³ × |6 8| = -1 × (30-64) = **34**
                                      |8 5|

**Position (3,1)**: C₃₁ = (-1)³⁺¹ × |8 9| = 1 × (56-45) = **11**
                                      |5 7|

**Position (3,2)**: C₃₂ = (-1)³⁺² × |6 9| = -1 × (42-90) = **48**
                                      |10 7|

**Position (3,3)**: C₃₃ = (-1)³⁺³ × |6  8| = 1 × (30-80) = **-50**
                                      |10 5|

**Cofactor Matrix**:
```
C = [-5  -4  10 ]
    [-3 -36  34 ]
    [11  48 -50 ]
```

## Part 3: Calculate the Inverse (X'X)⁻¹

### Mathematical Foundation
```
(X'X)⁻¹ = (1/det(X'X)) × Adj(X'X)
```
where Adj(X'X) is the adjugate (transpose of cofactor matrix)

### Step-by-Step Calculation

**Step 1**: Transpose the cofactor matrix to get the adjugate
```
Adj(X'X) = C' = [-5  -3  11 ]
                 [-4 -36  48 ]
                 [10  34 -50 ]
```

**Step 2**: Multiply by 1/determinant
```
(X'X)⁻¹ = (1/28) × [-5  -3  11 ]   = [-0.18 -0.11  0.39]
                    [-4 -36  48 ]     [-0.14 -1.29  1.71]
                    [10  34 -50 ]     [ 0.36  1.21 -1.79]
```

### Verification
We can verify this is correct by checking that (X'X) × (X'X)⁻¹ = I (identity matrix).

## Part 4: Compute the b-estimator Vector

### Final Calculation
```
b = (X'X)⁻¹X'y = [-0.18 -0.11  0.39] × [120]
                  [-0.14 -1.29  1.71]   [150]
                  [ 0.36  1.21 -1.79]   [160]
```

**Step-by-Step Multiplication**:

**b₁** = (-0.18×120) + (-0.11×150) + (0.39×160) = -21.6 - 16.5 + 62.4 = **24.3**

**b₂** = (-0.14×120) + (-1.29×150) + (1.71×160) = -16.8 - 193.5 + 273.6 = **63.3**

**b₃** = (0.36×120) + (1.21×150) + (-1.79×160) = 43.2 + 181.5 - 286.4 = **-61.7**

Wait, let me recalculate this more carefully using the exact values from the solution:

Using the exact fractional form:
```
b = (1/28) × [-5  -3  11] × [120]   = (1/28) × [710]    = [25.36]
              [-4 -36  48]   [150]             [1800]      [64.29]
              [10  34 -50]   [160]             [-1700]     [-60.71]
```

**Final Answer**:
```
b = [25.36]  (Intercept)
    [64.29]  (Coefficient for Operations A downtime)
    [-60.71] (Coefficient for Operations B downtime)
```

## Interpretation of Results

### Regression Equation
```
Cost of Data Breach = 25.36 + 64.29×(Downtime A) - 60.71×(Downtime B)
```

### Business Insights

1. **Intercept (25.36 T€)**: Base cost of a data breach when both downtimes are zero
2. **Operations A Coefficient (+64.29)**: Each minute of downtime in Operations A increases breach cost by €64,290
3. **Operations B Coefficient (-60.71)**: Surprisingly, downtime in Operations B appears to reduce breach costs by €60,710 per minute

### Why the Negative Coefficient?
The negative coefficient for Operations B might indicate:
- **Correlation with other factors**: Operations B downtime might be correlated with effective response measures
- **Data limitation**: This could be a limitation of the current dataset
- **Business logic**: Perhaps Operations B downtime represents controlled shutdowns that prevent larger breaches

## Practical Applications

### Matrix Methods in Data Analysis
1. **Efficiency**: Matrix operations allow handling multiple variables simultaneously
2. **Computational**: Modern statistical software uses these matrix operations internally
3. **Scalability**: Methods work for any number of variables

### Risk Management Implications
1. **Quantitative modeling**: Convert operational metrics into financial impact
